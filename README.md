## Health Care Near Us
Our mission is to provide information regarding the medicare certified healthcare institutions and their quality of care measured by Five-Star Quality Rating System by CMS, so you can make informed decisions for all the healthcare needs for you and your loved ones. You can choose the institutions according to your needs, their ratings by medicare and proximity to you.

You can access this project [here](/healthcarenearus).

### Background
This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. The data is provided by [Data.Medicare.gov](https://data.medicare.gov/). The project uses 4 different APIs to fetch information regarding 4 types of healthcare institutions that are located at a given zip code. [Check this out](https://data.medicare.gov/about) for more info about accessing data for various healthcare institutions.

### Things to do
The project can be extensible in the following ways:
* Locate each healthcare institution on a map
* Provide the ability to search both within state and zip code
* Show facilities within a certain distance from a given zip code
* Provide more detailed info for each institution
* Expand the search all available healthcare institution types
* Automatically detect the user's current location
* Add more criteria to search - e.g. show only 4+ star rating institutions
